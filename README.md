# 📚 Online Bookstore SQL Project

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of an **Online Bookstore** using **PostgreSQL**. It involves designing a relational schema, importing datasets, and executing various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The project uses three CSV files representing core entities of an online bookstore:

- **Books.csv** – Contains book details:  
  `Books(Book_ID, Title, Author, Genre, Published_Year, Price, Stock)`

- **Customers.csv** – Stores customer information:  
  `Customers(Customer_ID, Name, Email, Phone, City, Country)`

- **Orders.csv** – Captures order records:  
  `Orders(Order_ID, Customer_ID, Book_ID, Order_Date, Quantity, Total_Amount)`

These datasets were imported into PostgreSQL using `COPY` or `\copy`.
